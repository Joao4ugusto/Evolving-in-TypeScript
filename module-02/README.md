# Primitive types in TypescriptðŸ”¥

## In TypeScript, you can work with various primitive types to declare variables. Below are the primitive types available in TypeScript:

- **number:** Represents numbers, whether integers or floating-point.
- **string:** Represents sequences of characters.
- **boolean:** Represents true or false values.
- **symbol:** Represents unique and immutable identifiers, often used as keys for object properties.
- **null:** Represents the intentional absence of a value.
- **undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **bigint:** Represents arbitrarily large integers.
- **object:** Represents any non-primitive value. This includes arrays, object literals, functions, classes, etc.
- **any:** Represents a value that can be of any type. Avoid using this whenever possible, as it eliminates the benefits of TypeScript's static typing.
- **void:** Represents the absence of any type. Typically used to declare that a function doesn't return any value.
- **never:** Represents a type that never occurs. Often used for functions that throw exceptions or have infinite loops.
